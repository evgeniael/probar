The driver, Jim Sikes, said he was traveling east on Interstate 8 outside of the San Diego area when he attempted to pass a slower vehicle. 

""I pushed the gas pedal to pass a car, and it just did something kind of funny ... and it just stuck there,"" he said at a news conference outside a Highway Patrol office. ""As I was going, I was trying the brakes ... and it just kept speeding up.""

Alerted by emergency dispatchers, a California Highway Patrol officer was able to catch up to Sikes' Prius and used the patrol car's public address system to instruct Sikes to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time.

The territory of ""South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands"" was formed in 1985; previously it had been governed as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. Argentina claimed South Georgia in 1927 and claimed the South Sandwich Islands in 1938. \n\nArgentina maintained a naval station, Corbeta Uruguay, on Thule Island in the South Sandwich Islands from 1976 until 1982 when it was closed by the Royal Navy. The Argentine claim over South Georgia contributed to the 1982 Falklands War, during which Argentine forces briefly occupied the island.

""Today, the Court found that more time is needed to explore Mr. Hill's complaint, which raises serious concerns about the extreme secrecy surrounding the execution process in Georgia, and the new Lethal Injection Secrecy Act, which took effect one day before Georgia issued a death warrant for Mr. Hill,"" Brian Kammer, Hill's attorney said in a statement. 

Monday is not the first time Hill's execution has been halted. 

He had previously been scheduled to die last July, but the state Supreme Court stopped the execution on procedural grounds. Hill was granted another stay in February. 

According to Kammer, a briefing on Hill's complaint will take place Thursday. A new execution date is expected to be set for the same day, he said. 

""Ultimately, we are hopeful that the United States Supreme Court will hear Mr. Hill's pending Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, and will have the opportunity to consider the important new evidence in this case, that there is unanimous consensus among all the doctors who have examined Mr. Hill, including three who previously testified for the state, that he is a person with mental retardation, and thus ineligible for the death penalty,"" said Kammer. ","Context: (CNN) -- A court in Fulton County, Georgia, has temporarily stopped the scheduled Monday night execution of condemned murderer Warren Hill. 

Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of Joseph Handspike, another inmate in a Georgia state prison.

THE PIGS' CURE. 

It was not long before our hero recovered from his delirium. Leading, as he had been doing, an abstemious and healthy life, ordinary disease could not long maintain its grasp of him. His superabundant life seemed to cast it off with the ease with which his physical frame was able to cast aside human foes. But he could not thus shake off the leprosy.

Bladud became suddenly aware that he had not been dreaming, but he did not move. Through his slightly opened eyelids he watched the lad while he mixed some berries in a cup of water. As he lay thus silently observant, he was deeply impressed with the handsome countenance of his nurse and the graceful movements of his slight figure. ","Context: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO. 

THE PIGS' CURE. 

It was not long before our hero recovered from his delirium. Leading, as he had been doing, an abstemious and healthy life, ordinary disease could not long maintain its grasp of him. His superabundant life seemed to cast it off with the ease with which his physical frame was able to cast aside human foes. But he could not thus shake off the leprosy.

The duties of Master Pugsy Maloney at the offices of _Cosy Moments_ were not heavy; and he was accustomed to occupy his large store of leisure by reading narratives dealing with life in the prairies, which he acquired at a neighbouring shop at cut rates in consideration of their being shop-soiled. It was while he was engrossed in one of these, on the morning following the visit of Mr. Parker, that the seedy-looking man made his appearance. He walked in from the street, and stood before Master Maloney. 

""Hey, kid,"" he said. 

Pugsy looked up with some hauteur. He resented being addressed as ""kid"" by perfect strangers. 

""Editor in, Tommy?"" inquired the man. 

Pugsy by this time had taken a thorough dislike to him. To be called ""kid"" was bad. The subtle insult of ""Tommy"" was still worse. 

""Nope,"" he said curtly, fixing his eyes again on his book. A movement on the part of the visitor attracted his attention. The seedy man was making for the door of the inner room. Pugsy instantly ceased to be the student and became the man of action. He sprang from his seat and wriggled in between the man and the door. 

""Youse can't butt in dere,"" he said authoritatively. ""Chase yerself."" 

The man eyed him with displeasure. 

""Fresh kid!"" he observed disapprovingly. 

""Fade away,"" urged Master Maloney. 

The visitor's reply was to extend a hand and grasp Pugsy's left ear between a long finger and thumb. Since time began, small boys in every country have had but one answer for this action. Pugsy made it. He emitted a piercing squeal in which pain, fear, and resentment strove for supremacy. ","Context: CHAPTER XI

That's what some people are saying for college athletes. They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries. 

Top athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. ""Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,"" he explains. ""Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?"" 

The students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons. 

College athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school. 

The money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. ""Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,"" Massett explains. 

In addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. ""Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,"" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school.","Context: ""Show them the money!"" That's what some people are saying for college athletes.

""I'm separated from my husband right now, which has been a very difficult thing to go through,"" she told Billboard's ""Pop Shop"" podcast. ""In the beginning, the album was a lot heavier and a lot darker, because I had to get that out. Once I did get that out, a lot of fun came."" 

Duff married Comrie, a former pro hockey player, in 2010 after dating for three years. Their son, Luca, was born in 2012. Duff and Comrie announced their separation in January. 

Duff, 26, admits that she's ""nervous"" after being away from music for seven years. Her just-released single, ""Chasing the Sun,"" is from her still-untitled album, which will be her first studio release since 2007's ""Dignity."" 

She says she first started thinking of new material when she was pregnant with her son. After having the child and taking another year, she was even more anxious. 

""I felt like I was missing a big part of myself,"" she said. 

Duff established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular Disney show, ""Lizzie McGuire,"" which aired from 2001 to 2004. She spent most of her teenage years touring and says that turning 20 was a big factor in leaving the road. 

""It was time for me to be a person, and the break just ended up being a long time,"" she said. ","Context: (CNN) -- Hilary Duff says her new album is ""very positive"" but admits that it started out ""a lot heavier and a lot darker"" because of the separation from her husband, Mike Comrie.

Smile back, but don't stop squeezing Iran with sanctions. 

Rouhani has offered a series of positive gestures since taking office in early August. He has released some political prisoners. He sent New Year's greetings to Jews in Iran and around the world. He took a phone call from the president of the United States. 

Does any of this portend real change in Iran? 

The case for skepticism is strong. None of the regime has changed in any way. Iran continues to make mischief through the region, most horrifically by supporting the brutal actions of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. As far as anyone can tell, Iran pursues nuclear weapons as determinedly as ever. 

Rouhani himself is no liberal and no Democrat. An early supporter of the Ayatollah Khomeini, Rouhani held senior positions in the Iranian state during the regime's most vicious period of international terrorism, the early 1990s - the years in which Iranian-backed terrorists carried out assassinations in Berlin and Paris and carried out two terrible bombings of Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, killing 114 people and wounding nearly a thousand more. 

As Iran's chief nuclear negotiator in the 2000s, Rouhani nimbly evaded international efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the country's drive for weapons of mass death. 

More fundamentally, the president of Iran does not govern the country's national security system. The military and the secret police answer to the supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khameini, who has very emphatic geopolitical ideas of his own. Compared with all that, a cheerful tweet and a few words of condemnation of Nazi crimes don't seem much of an offset. ","Context: How to react to Iran's new smiley-faced president, Hassan Rouhani?

For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to idealism, neutral monism, and spiritualism. \n\nDespite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: Idealism, and materialism.[a] The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: ""what does reality consist of?"" and ""how does it originate?"" To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary, the product of matter acting upon matter.', 'Question: What would be secondary to them?', 'Answer: matter is primary, and

Thus began my life in London in the house of my uncle, John Grimmer, who was called the Goldsmith. In truth, however, he was more than this, since not only did he fashion and trade in costly things; he lent out moneys to interest upon security to great people who needed it, and even to the king Richard and his Court. Also he owned ships and did much commerce with Holland, France, yes, and with Spain and Italy. Indeed, although he appeared so humble, his wealth was very large and always increased, like a snowball rolling down a hill; moreover, he owned much land, especially in the neighbourhood of London where it was likely to grow in value. 

""Money melts,"" he would say, ""furs corrupt with moth and time, and thieves break in and steal. But land--if the title be good--remains. Therefore buy land, which none can carry away, near to a market or a growing town if may be, and hire it out to fools to farm, or sell it to other fools who wish to build great houses and spend their goods in feeding a multitude of idle servants.

I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. 

I had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. 

After the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, ""Hi, can I sit down here?"" ""I would like to know if I could give you $10?"" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. 

I then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him.

The paintings of Paul Cezanne had a lot of influence in the development of 20th century art, including Cubism and Fauvism .

Henri Matisse was one of the most important famous French artists of the 20th century. He was considered one of the leaders of the Fauvist movement.

Mary and I (as you may remember) had left the bailiff alone at the decoy, and had set forth on our way together to Dermody's cottage. 

As we approached the garden gate, I saw a servant from the house waiting there. He carried a message from my mother--a message for me. 

""My mistress wishes you to go home, Master George, as soon as you can. A letter has come by the coach. My master means to take a post-chaise from London, and sends word that we may expect him in the course of the day."" 

Mary's attentive face saddened when she heard those words. 

""Must you really go away, George,"" she whispered, ""before you see what I have got waiting for you at home?"" 

I remembered Mary's promised ""surprise,"" the secret of which was only to be revealed to me when we got to the cottage. How could I disappoint her? My poor little lady-love looked ready to cry at the bare prospect of it. 

I dismissed the servant with a message of the temporizing sort. My love to my mother--and I would be back at the house in half an hour. 

We entered the cottage. 

Dame Dermody was sitting in the light of the window, as usual, with one of the mystic books of Emanuel Swedenborg open on her lap. She solemnly lifted her hand on our appearance, signing to us to occupy our customary corner without speaking to her. It was an act of domestic high treason to interrupt the Sibyl at her books. We crept quietly into our places. Mary waited until she saw her grandmother's gray head bend down, and her grandmother's bushy eyebrows contract attentively, over her reading. Then, and then only, the discreet child rose on tiptoe, disappeared noiselessly in the direction of her bedchamber, and came back to me carrying something carefully wrapped up in her best cambric handkerchief.

 Answer:","['Silesia (; ; ; ; Silesian German: ""Schläsing""; Silesian: ""Ślůnsk"" ; ; ; ) is a region of Central Europe located mostly in Poland, with small parts in the Czech Republic and Germany. Its area is about , and its population about 8,000,000. Silesia is located along the Oder River. It consists of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. \n\nThe region is rich in mineral and natural resources, and includes several important industrial areas. Silesia\'s largest city and historical capital is Wrocław. The biggest metropolitan area is the Upper Silesian metropolitan area, the centre of which is Katowice. Parts of the Czech city of Ostrava fall within the borders of Silesia. \n\nSilesia\'s borders and national affiliation have changed over time, both when it was a hereditary possession of noble houses and after the rise of modern nation-states. The first known states to hold power there were probably those of Greater Moravia at the end of the 9th century and Bohemia early in the 10th century. In the 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state, and after its division in the 12th century became a Piast duchy. In the 14th century, it became a constituent part of the Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire, which passed to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526.', 'Question: What did it become in

GEORGE II. A.D. 1725--1760. 

The reign of George II. was a very warlike one. Indeed he was the last king of England who ever was personally in a battle; and, curiously enough, this battle--that of Fontenoy--was the last that a king of France also was present in. It was, however, not a very interesting battle; and it was not clear who really won it, nor are wars of this time very easy to understand. 

The battle of Fontenoy was fought in the course of a great war to decide who would be emperor of Germany, in which France and England took different sides; and this made Charles Edward Stuart, the eldest son of James, think it was a good moment for trying once again to get back the crown of his forefathers. He was a fine-looking young man, with winning manners, and a great deal more spirit than his father: and when he landed in Scotland with a very few followers, one Highland gentleman after another was so delighted with him that they all brought their clans to join him, and he was at the head of quite a large force, with which he took possession of the town of Edinburgh; but he never could take the castle. The English army was most of it away fighting in Germany, and the soldiers who met him at Prestonpans, close to Edinburgh, were not well managed, and were easily beaten by the Highlanders. Then he marched straight on into England: and there was great terror, for the Highlanders--with their plaids, long swords, and strange language--were thought to be all savage robbers, and the Londoners expected to have every house and shop ruined and themselves murdered: though on the whole the Highlanders behaved very well. They would probably have really entered London if they had gone on, and reached it before the army could come home, but they grew discontented and frightened at being so far away from their own hills; and at Derby.

Gold medal performances require some serious nutrition. Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape? 

Keri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on ""Good Morning America"" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. 

Crazy Calorie Count 

_ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. 

Athletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished in order to train the following day. 

Snacking Secrets 

Some athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. 

Jonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. 

Foods for Recovery 

What are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? 

For Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said.","Context: It takes more than just practice to become an Olympian.

THE SKATING RACE 

For nearly half a mile Peter Slade kept the lead with ease, but then his breath began to fail him. Looking over his shoulder, he saw both Larry and Dick crawling up. 

""No, you don't!"" he muttered, and put on a fresh burst of speed that increased his lead by two yards. 

""Peter Slade is going to win!"" 

""See how he is running away from the others!"" 

So the cries arose and it certainly looked as if the youth mentioned could not possibly be defeated. 

But now both Larry and Dick ""dug in for all they were worth,"" as they themselves expressed it. While there was yet a quarter of a mile to be covered Dick made a spurt and ranged up alongside of his chum. 

""Sorry, but I've got to go ahead!"" he cried, gaily. 

""Come on, we'll both go!"" yelled Larry, good naturedly, and then the pair put on a fresh effort and in a moment ranged up on either side of Peter Slade. 

""Hullo, they are in a line!"" 

""There goes Larry Colby ahead!"" 

""Dick Rover is going with him!"" 

""Say, but that is skating, eh? Just look at Dick strike out!"" 

""Sandwick is coming up, too!""

The last reports were true. The fourth and fifth boy were now directly behind Slade. As Dick and Larry shot ahead, still side by side, Sandwick overtook Slade and so did Marley. In the meantime the sixth boy had lost a skate and dropped out. ","Context: CHAPTER XXVI

Was the series finale of ""Breaking Bad"" satisfying? Did it tie up all loose ends? Did the character you wanted to live survive and did the ones you wanted to die get their just deserts? Is it sending you back to the beginning to binge watch it all over again? 

Just when it seemed Walt was heading out of his New Hampshire hideaway to exact revenge on Elliot and Gretchen Schwartz (for dismissing his involvement with Gray Matter Technologies in the episode previous), he pulled the first of several surprises of the evening. Instead of threatening to kill them outright, he asks them to set up a trust fund so that his children would benefit from the money he'd illegally amassed (presumably the goal of his entire meth enterprise to begin with). 

Gretchen and Elliott of course are terrified by his sudden appearance in their ritzy new home, but had they been paying attention, they would have seen Walt waltz on in. His entrance is a bit ironic, considering their wealth and legitimacy is in some way a result of his earlier contributions. He's always been there, in the shadows, whether they acknowledged him or not.

It's a bluff, but they don't know that, so it's a win-win. Walt's children will get the money in a semi-legal fashion, and no one will actually die in the process.

Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.
 Question:how did they know to?
 Answer:it was on a map.
 Question:where did they find that?
 Answer:","[""On a nice and sunny day, Bob and Sally walked to the beach. When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they didn't find anything. This made Bob and Sally very sad. They gave up and went to play in the water. While they were playing in the water, Sally found a bottle with a little paper inside. Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map. Sally showed the map to Bob and they started to look for the treasure. After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole, they found a box. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. Bob slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl. Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl. The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them rich.

Democrats and Republicans totally disagree about the significance of the GOP's victory in the first major competitive congressional ballot box test of 2014. 

Republican candidate David Jolly narrowly edged out Democrat Alex Sink to win Tuesday's special election in Florida's 13th Congressional District. Jolly will fill out the term of his former boss, longtime Republican Rep. Bill Young, who died in October. 

Republicans win first election showdown of the year 

The race was consistently in the spotlight with national Republicans framing the election as a referendum on Obamacare. They injected a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race and some pundits cast the election as a possible bellwether for November's midterms. 

""I think this was a referendum on (President Barack Obama's) policies and on Obamacare, that played out significantly to the disadvantage of (House Democratic Leader) Nancy Pelosi. And I think it sets the tone for what's coming in the fall,"" Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN Wednesday. 

""We've been trying to tell people this is a referendum election, Obamacare is not helping people the way it was promised, and Democrats are going to have a lot of answering to do,"" Walden added. 

But his counterpart at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sees very little predictive value in the results. 

""Special elections are not indicators of the future. They never have been. They never will be. And certainly this is not an indicator of the future,"" Rep. Steve Israel, the DCCC chairman, told reporters. ","Context: (CNN) -- Here's something shocking.

The injury-hit defending champions brushed off the pre-match loss of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to romp into a 3-0 halftime lead as they put pressure on Real Madrid to win Sunday's home match against Villarreal. 

The Swede is in doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to German club Stuttgart due to a swollen ankle. 

Midfielder Andres Iniesta took advantage of some slack defending to pounce for his first goal this season in the seventh minute, hooking home a left-foot effort after the ball ran loose in his 300th outing for the club. 

France striker Thierry Henry, handed a rare start due to Ibrahimovic's absence, netted a free-kick in the 29th minute after driving a shot through the defensive wall for his first goal this year. 

Center-back Rafael Marquez marked his return from suspension with a similar effort nine minute later as he curled a set-piece over the wall and in off the post. 

Barca took their foot off the pedal in the second half, but 18-year-old Thiago scored his first senior goal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot after Lionel Messi set him up with a cutback. 

Captain Carles Puyol had to go off with a facial injury but is expected to face Stuttgart in the first leg of the last-16 tie.

For ten or twelve days after the little dinner in Berkeley Square Guss Mildmay bore her misfortunes without further spoken complaint. During all that time, though they were both in London, she never saw Jack De Baron, and she knew that in not seeing her he was neglecting her. But for so long she bore it. It is generally supposed that young ladies have to bear such sorrow without loud complaint; but Guss was more thoroughly emancipated than are some young ladies, and when moved was wont to speak her mind. At last, when she herself was only on foot with her father, she saw Jack De Baron riding with Lady George. It is quite true that she also saw, riding behind them, her perfidious friend, Mrs. Houghton, and a gentleman whom at that time she did not know to be Lady George's father. This was early in March, when equestrians in the park are not numerous. Guss stood for a moment looking at them, and Jack De Baron took off his hat. But Jack did not stop, and went on talking with that pleasant vivacity which she, poor girl, knew so well and valued so highly. Lady George liked it too, though she could hardly have given any reason for liking it, for, to tell the truth, there was not often much pith in Jack's conversation. 

On the following morning Captain De Baron, who had lodgings in Charles Street close to the Guards' Club, had a letter brought to him before he was out of bed. The letter was from Guss Mildmay, and he knew the handwriting well. He had received many notes from her, though none so interesting on the whole as was this letter. Miss Mildmay's letter to Jack was as follows. It was written, certainly, with a swift pen, and, but that he knew her writing well, would in parts have been hardly legible. ","Context: CHAPTER XV.

But Jack did not stop, and went on talking with that pleasant vivacity which she, poor girl, knew so well and valued so highly. Lady George liked it too, though she could hardly have given any reason for liking it, for, to tell the truth, there was not often much pith in Jack's conversation. 

On the following morning Captain De Baron, who had lodgings in Charles Street close to the Guards' Club, had a letter brought to him before he was out of bed. The letter was from Guss Mildmay, and he knew the handwriting well. He had received many notes from her, though none so interesting on the whole as was this letter. Miss Mildmay's letter to Jack was as follows. It was written, certainly, with a swift pen, and, but that he knew her writing well, would in parts have been hardly legible. 
 Question:anyone else?
 Answer:yes.
 Question:who/
 Answer:","['CHAPTER XV. \n\n""DROP IT."" \n\nFor ten or twelve days after the little dinner in Berkeley Square Guss Mildmay bore her misfortunes without further spoken complaint. During all that time, though they were both in London, she never saw Jack De Baron, and she knew that in not seeing her he was neglecting her. But for so long she bore it. It is generally supposed that young ladies have to bear such sorrow without loud complaint; but Guss was more thoroughly emancipated than are some young ladies, and when moved was wont to speak her mind. At last, when she herself was only on foot with her father, she saw Jack De Baron riding with Lady George.

""Have you heard the news, my dear, from the Small House?"" said Mrs Boyce to her husband, some two or three days after Mrs Dale's visit to the squire. It was one o'clock, and the parish pastor had come in from his ministrations to dine with his wife and children. 

""What news?"" said Mr Boyce, for he had heard none. 

""Mrs Dale and the girls are going to leave the Small House; they're going into Guestwick to live."" 

""Mrs Dale going away; nonsense!"" said the vicar. ""What on earth should take her into Guestwick? She doesn't pay a shilling of rent where she is."" 

""I can assure you it's true, my dear. I was with Mrs Hearn just now, and she had it direct from Mrs Dale's own lips. Mrs Hearn said she'd never been taken so much aback in her whole life. There's been some quarrel, you may be sure of that."" 

Mr Boyce sat silent, pulling off his dirty shoes preparatory to his dinner. Tidings so important, as touching the social life of his parish, had not come to him for many a day, and he could hardly bring himself to credit them at so short a notice. 

""Mrs Hearn says that Mrs Dale spoke ever so firmly about it, as though determined that nothing should change her.""

""Well, not exactly. But Mrs Hearn said she could understand there had been words between her and the squire. It couldn't be anything else, you know. Probably it had something to do with that man, Crosbie."" ","Context: CHAPTER XXXIX

Stenson did not leave much to the imagination with his Doral antics. 

Stenson stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot. 

The watching galleries could hardly believe their eyes as the tall Swede peeled off his clothes. 

""Shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, hat, the lot was off,"" he told the Press Association. 

""Because of the mud I couldn't really afford to play in any of my clothes as they would have been a real mess down the last six or so holes so I had no option,"" Stenson explained.

The 34-year-old has been at the summit for an unprecedented 612 weeks in total, but once again faces the prospect of losing top spot to fellow American Phil Mickelson -- and a new contender, world No. 3 Lee Westwood. 

While second-ranked Mickelson has failed to take advantage of Woods' struggles in recent weeks, finishing only tied for 48th at the British Open, Westwood has racked up the points after placing second at his home major last month. 

The Englishman can go to No. 1 if he wins at Firestone and Woods is outside the top two -- or if he is second, the defending champion is 10th or lower and Mickelson does not win. 

Mickelson can finally surpass Woods if he wins, or if he finishes in the top four and his compatriot is outside the top 37. 

""Am I conscious of the pack closing in? Yes, because every tournament you guys remind me,"" Woods told reporters on Wednesday ahead of his bid for an eighth title in the event. 

""You play. How I got here was playing golf tournaments and winning golf tournaments."" 

Woods will partner Westwood for the first two rounds in Akron, knowing that his rival has finished second in two majors this year and was runner-up at Firestone behind Vijay Singh in 2008.

For Jane Black, a six-year friendship ended when her friend was rude to one of her children. ""After quite a few drinks at a party in my house, she said something rude to my child. I ended the friendship face to face at the party,"" she says. ""I didn't realize what I was doing at the time, I was simply standing up for my child, but in her eyes any challenge was a betrayal."" 

When Angela Thompson noticed a seven-year friendship disappearing, she let it go. ""I didn't know how to deal with the issue. I didn't sit down for a grown-up conversation; I just walked away quietly."" The decision caused a reaction among Thompson's other friends. ""The other friends in the circle are the worst people when you are trying to break up with a friend,"" she says. ""They don't want you to stop being friends, because it puts them in a difficult position. You get told to just get it over."" 

Though we have plenty of measures for handling conflict at work or family fight, we still don't have good ways of ending friendships. Do we sit down and properly break up, or just walk away? Psychologist Serena Cauchy has the following advice. 

Don't blame. 

Talk about your needs and feeling rather than talking like a Dutch uncle. 

Do talk about your needs. 

Talk about why the friendship is not working for you--about how your needs aren't being met. 

Don't gossip. 

Negative talk hurts everyone involved and in some cases can make matters worse. 

Don't be so accessible. 

If there is a common wish to conclude the friendship, then you can remove it.","Context: When it comes to relationship, we spend a lot of time discussing their joys, but rarely talk about the pain when they break down. Yet most people have a story about a broken relationship.

However, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy. When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write.

""Of course, I want to know your opinion about all this,"" he said, ""but not yet. I have more to say. There has been a business plan proposed by two members of our party which concerns me, and when anything is told concerning me, I want to know how it is told, or, if possible, tell it myself.""

When Soames entered his sister's little Louis Quinze drawing-room, with its small balcony, always flowered with hanging geraniums in the summer, and now with pots of Lilium Auratum, he was struck by the immutability of human affairs. It looked just the same as on his first visit to the newly married Darties twenty-one years ago. He had chosen the furniture himself, and so completely that no subsequent purchase had ever been able to change the room's atmosphere. Yes, he had founded his sister well, and she had wanted it. Indeed, it said a great deal for Winifred that after all this time with Dartie she remained well-founded. From the first Soames had nosed out Dartie's nature from underneath the plausibility, savoir faire, and good looks which had dazzled Winifred, her mother, and even James, to the extent of permitting the fellow to marry his daughter without bringing anything but shares of no value into settlement. 

Winifred, whom he noticed next to the furniture, was sitting at her Buhl bureau with a letter in her hand. She rose and came towards him. Tall as himself, strong in the cheekbones, well tailored, something in her face disturbed Soames. She crumpled the letter in her hand, but seemed to change her mind and held it out to him. He was her lawyer as well as her brother. 

Soames read, on Iseeum Club paper, these words: 

'You will not get chance to insult in my own again. I am leaving country to-morrow. It's played out. I'm tired of being insulted by you. You've brought on yourself. No self-respecting man can stand it. I shall not ask you for anything again. Good-bye. I took the photograph of the two girls. Give them my love. I don't care what your family say.

It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. 

Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna.","Context: An antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa.

After having the child and taking another year, she was even more anxious. \n\n""I felt like I was missing a big part of myself,"" she said. \n\nDuff established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular Disney show, ""Lizzie McGuire,"" which aired from 2001 to 2004. She spent most of her teenage years touring and says that turning 20 was a big factor in leaving the road. \n\n""It was time for me to be a person, and the break just ended up being a long time,"" she said.

""That's the way I am going to vote, too."" 

""How about the two captains?"" asked Joe Nelson. 

""Well, I think I'll vote for Dave Kearney for one,"" answered Pepper. ""I am not so sure about the other."" 

""What's the matter with Harry Blossom?"" asked Bert Field. ""He seems to be a nice sort."" 

""He is."" 

""I understand Reff Ritter wants to be a captain,"" put in Stuffer. 

""Sure, an' he'd be afther wantin' to be major, only he ain't popular enough,"" came from Emerald. 

""Coulter is out for a captaincy, too,"" said Jack, who had come up during the talk. 

""Do you think either of them will be elected?"" asked Andy. 

""Not if I can prevent it,"" replied the young major. ""Neither of them deserves any office."" 

""I understand Dan Baxter wants to be major,"" said Stuffer. ""Talk about gall! What has he ever done for the school? Nothing."" 

""He won't get the office,"" said Jack. 

""Is Bart going to have a walkover?"" asked Pepper. 

""Hardly. Both Dave Kearney and Harry Blossom will run against him, and so will Bob Grenwood, and they all have their friends."" 

""Well, let the best fellows win, say I!"" cried Andy, and then he ran off, to do some fancy ""stunts"" in the gymnasium.

He has prospered during the Libyan leader's 41-year reign, first as a professional and later taking care of his deceased father's businesses. 

But, as with many things in Tripoli, a first glance can be deceiving. 

""Ninety percent of the people in Tripoli hate Gadhafi,"" Mahmoud told me over sips of espresso at a corner coffee shop this weekend. ""All his people do is tell lies. If anyone tells you different they are just afraid."" 

CNN is withholding his real name for his own safety. 

On an almost hourly basis, regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months. 

CNN, like other media here, is under severe government restrictions. But I recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several Libyans. 

And according to several eyewitness accounts, major demonstrations were held against Libya's strongman as recently as last week. 

And in the Souq al-Juma neighborhood of the capital, where anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted in February, the government's propaganda bubble is quickly burst. 

While international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon, multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces. 

""They were protesting right around the corner. They streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square,"" said Mahmoud. ""Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds.""

The group met Presley after a performance with Eddy Arnold in 1955.

'}]","(CNN) -- He was the soccer referee known as ""golden whistle"" who officiated in high-profile events such as the World Cup and the Olympics. 

But a Chinese court has called fulltime on Lun Ju's career by jailing him for match fixing. 

China's state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that Lu has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison by a court in Liaoning Province after accepting $128,000 to fix seven matches in China's national league. 

Three other officials -- Huang Junjie, Wan Daxue and Zhou Weixin -- were also jailed for seven, six, and three and a half years respectively. 

The cases were brought after a government crackdown on persistent allegations of gambling, match fixing and corruption in China's football leagues was launched in 2009. 

But it is the fall of Lu that has grabbed the most headlines around the world. He was the first Chinese official to referee at a World Cup, when South Korea and Japan hosted the showpiece event in 2002. 

Prior to that he had taken charge of matches at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was twice voted referee of the year by the Asian Football Confederation. 

But the court in the city of Dandong, near the border with North Korea, found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua, who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea. 

Huang was convicted of accepting $247,975 from seven separate cases while $31,760 of his personal assets were also confiscated. ","Context: (CNN) -- He was the soccer referee known as ""golden whistle"" who officiated in high-profile events such as the World Cup and the Olympics.

""I'm separated from my husband right now, which has been a very difficult thing to go through,"" she told Billboard's ""Pop Shop"" podcast. ""In the beginning, the album was a lot heavier and a lot darker, because I had to get that out. Once I did get that out, a lot of fun came."" 

Duff married Comrie, a former pro hockey player, in 2010 after dating for three years. Their son, Luca, was born in 2012. Duff and Comrie announced their separation in January. 

Duff, 26, admits that she's ""nervous"" after being away from music for seven years. Her just-released single, ""Chasing the Sun,"" is from her still-untitled album, which will be her first studio release since 2007's ""Dignity."" 

She says she first started thinking of new material when she was pregnant with her son. After having the child and taking another year, she was even more anxious. 

""I felt like I was missing a big part of myself,"" she said. 

Duff established a successful singing career on the heels of her popular Disney show, ""Lizzie McGuire,"" which aired from 2001 to 2004. She spent most of her teenage years touring and says that turning 20 was a big factor in leaving the road. 

""It was time for me to be a person, and the break just ended up being a long time,"" she said. ","Context: (CNN) -- Hilary Duff says her new album is ""very positive"" but admits that it started out ""a lot heavier and a lot darker"" because of the separation from her husband, Mike Comrie.

""Whatever IS the matter, men?"" she said, meeting them at the door just as she was coming out on her way to church, and ceasing in a moment from the close compression of her two red lips, with which she had accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove. 

""Sixty!"" said Joseph Poorgrass.

""And they be getting blasted,"" said Henery Fray. 

""That they be,"" said Joseph. 

""And will all die as dead as nits, if they bain't got out and cured!"" said Tall. 

Joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and puckers by his concern. Fray's forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise, after the pattern of a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. Laban Tall's lips were thin, and his face was rigid. Matthew's jaws sank, and his eyes turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened to pull them.

He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him. But today the door was wide open, and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground.

The Australian rapper has broken her silence about a supposed feud between herself and Nicki Minaj, rumors that were sparked after Minaj gave a curiously pointed acceptance speech at the BET Awards on Sunday. 

The New York-bred MC made it clear that when ""you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it,"" leaving observers to assume that she was taking a dig at Azalea, who's been rumored to work with ghostwriters and was Minaj's competitor at the awards ceremony. 

Nicki Minaj vs. Iggy Azalea: Where's the beef? 

Although Minaj said during her acceptance speech that she wasn't giving ""shade"" -- aka, disrespect -- it nonetheless appeared that way to many. 

With the Internet chomping down on the apparent beef, both Minaj and Azalea have tried to clear the air. 

""The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different. I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us!"" Minaj tweeted on July 2. ""I've congratulated Iggy on the success of 'Fancy,' publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud. ... That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that."" 

Azalea initially remained silent on the subject, but by July 3 the rapper had grown tired of the commentary.

 Answer:","['(CNN) -- Iggy Azalea would love it if everyone channeled ""Frozen"" and just ""let it go."" \n\nThe Australian rapper has broken her silence about a supposed feud between herself and Nicki Minaj, rumors that were sparked after Minaj gave a curiously pointed acceptance speech at the BET Awards on Sunday. \n\nThe New York-bred MC made it clear that when ""you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it,"" leaving observers to assume that she was taking a dig at Azalea, who\'s been rumored to work with ghostwriters and was Minaj\'s competitor at the awards ceremony. \n\nNicki Minaj vs. Iggy Azalea: Where\'s the beef? \n\nAlthough Minaj said during her acceptance speech that she wasn\'t giving ""shade"" -- aka, disrespect -- it nonetheless appeared that way to many. \n\nWith the Internet chomping down on the apparent beef, both Minaj and Azalea have tried to clear the air. \n\n""The media puts words in my mouth all the time and this is no different. I will always take a stance on women writing b/c I believe in us!"" Minaj tweeted on July 2. ""I\'ve congratulated Iggy on the success of \'Fancy,\' publicly. She should be very proud of that. All the women nominated should b proud. ... That will never change my desire to motivate women to write. Our voices have to be heard. I hope I inspire up & coming females to do that."" \n\nAzalea initially remained silent on the subject, but by July 3 the rapper had grown tired of the commentary. \n\n""I have to say the general explosion of pettiness online in the last few days is hard to ignore and honestly ... lame,"" Azalea wrote in a statement, as captured on her Instagram account. ""If I had won the BET award that would\'ve been great but it wasn\'t my year and I don\'t mind -- so you shouldn\'t either.""
