""Tom, we are in a fix."" 

""So it would seem, Sam. Who ever dreamed of running across the Baxters in this fashion?"" 

""We are in the hands of a trio of rascals now, for Crabtree is as bad as the others."" 

""Perhaps, but he hasn't the nerve that Arnold Baxter has. What shall we do?"" 

""Try to get free."" 

""I can't budge an inch. Dan Baxter took especial delight in tying me up."" 

""I can move one hand and if--It is free! Hurrah!"" 

""Can you get the other hand free?"" 

""I can try. The rope--that's free, too. Now for my legs."" 

Sam Rover worked rapidly, and was soon as free as ever. Then he ran over to where Tom was tied up and liberated his brother. 

""Now, what shall we do?"" 

""I move we go after the people on that steam tug and get them to help us rescue Mrs. Stanhope."" 

""That's a good idea, and the quicker we go the better."" 

Sam remembered very well in what direction he had seen the tug, and now set a straight course across the island to the cove. 

But the trail led over a hill and through a dense thicket, and long before the journey was half finished both lads were well-nigh exhausted. 

""We ought to have followed the shore around--we would have got there quicker,"" panted Tom, as he fairly cut his way through the dense brush- wood. 

""I hope there are no wild animals here."" ","Context: CHAPTER XXVIII.

The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. 

It was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, ""I can stay"". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. 

We got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll ""Never"" forget. 

On Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. 

When we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock. That day was forever etched into our memories. 

It still hurts to think about it. Wishing we could have grown old together. Wondering how it would have been. I'm sure It WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.","Context: The story of the day I lost my best friend to a car accident. The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon.

Gaines Award for Literary Excellence. He is a 2010 Guggenheim Award winner and an assistant professor at Columbia University's School of the Arts. About ""Long Distance"" he says: ""This essay actually came about when I was asked to write about my life after having lost a great deal of weight. And yet, when I sat down to work, all I could do was return to that time when I was much heavier and deeply unhappy. Why? I sure didn't miss those days. And yet, I felt I couldn't write about my present without touching on that past. But, of course, I never reach the true present in the essay. Maybe I still don't know how to talk about a life with greater happiness. "" BRIDGET POTTER was born in Brompton-on-Swale, Yorkshire, and came to the United States as a teenager in 1958.

And yet, I felt I couldn't write about my present without touching on that past. But, of course, I never reach the true present in the essay. Maybe I still don't know how to talk about a life with greater happiness. "" BRIDGET POTTER was born in Brompton-on-Swale, Yorkshire, and came to the United States as a teenager in 1958.

He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. 

Born into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. 

He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. 

His first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12. When he was 16, he was forced to leave St. Paul Academy for neglecting his studies. He attended Newman School, a prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1911-1912, and entered Princeton University in 1913 as a member of the Class of 1917. There he became friends with future critics and writers Edmund Wilson (Class of 1916) and John Peale Bishop (Class of 1917), and wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club. He was also a member of the University Cottage Club, which still displays Fitzgerald's desk and writing materials in its library. A poor student, Fitzgerald left Princeton to enlist in the US Army during World War I; however, the war ended shortly after Fitzgerald's enlistment. 

Fitzgerald had been an alcoholic since his college days, leaving him in poor health by the late 1930s. Fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of tuberculosis in 1919, and died of a heart attack in 1940.","Context: Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896.

These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology.', 'Question: And

The current domestic violence case involving former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice is just the latest in a long list of controversies that have punctuated his reign atop the country's most profitable sports league. 

Here are some that have attracted the biggest headlines: 

Michael Vick's dog fighting arrest 

Allegations of Vick's participation in dog fighting activities began to swirl in April 2007. 

Within three months, the Atlanta Falcons quarterback and three associates were indicted in federal court. 

By the end of August, Vick reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors on one charge of conspiracy involving illegal dog fighting. Vick admitted participating in killing dogs and operating a business enterprise that involved illegal gambling. 

Goodell notified Vick that he was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely, without pay. 

Vick served 20 months for the conviction. 

In 2009, Goodell reinstated Vick to the league on a conditional basis. In 2011, he signed a six-year, $100 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, making Vick one of the highest earning players in the NFL. 

Vick is now a backup quarterback for the New York Jets. 

Plaxico Buress' nightclub incident 

The former New York Giants wide receiver accidentally shot himself in the leg with a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol he was carrying in his waistband. The incident happened November 2008, in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan. 

Buress served 20 months on a weapons charge. ","Context: Since Roger Goodell took over as NFL commissioner in September 2006, he's had his hands full. 

The current domestic violence case involving former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice is just the latest in a long list of controversies that have punctuated his reign atop the country's most profitable sports league. 

Here are some that have attracted the biggest headlines: 

Michael Vick's dog fighting arrest 

Allegations of Vick's participation in dog fighting activities began to swirl in April 2007. 

Within three months, the Atlanta Falcons quarterback and three associates were indicted in federal court. 

By the end of August, Vick reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors on one charge of conspiracy involving illegal dog fighting. Vick admitted participating in killing dogs and operating a business enterprise that involved illegal gambling.

Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair.

Charles had received a collection of manuscripts from his predecessor, John II, and transferred them to the Louvre from the Palais de la Cité. The first librarian of record was Claude Mallet, the king's valet de chambre, who made a sort of catalogue, ""Inventoire des Livres du Roy nostre Seigneur estans au Chastel du Louvre"".

On the following day, Tuesday, the Boncassens went, and then there were none of the guests left but Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel Grex,--with of course Miss Cassewary. The Duke had especially asked both Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel to remain, the former, through his anxiety to show his repentance for the injustice he had formerly done her, and the latter in the hope that something might be settled as soon as the crowd of visitors should have gone. He had never spoken quite distinctly to Mabel. He had felt that the manner in which he had learned his son's purpose,--that which once had been his son's purpose,--forbade him to do so. But he had so spoken as to make Lady Mabel quite aware of his wish. He would not have told her how sure he was that Silverbridge would keep no more racehorses, how he trusted that Silverbridge had done with betting, how he believed that the young member would take a real interest in the House of Commons, had he not intended that she should take a special interest in the young man. And then he had spoken about the house in London. It was to be made over to Silverbridge as soon as Silverbridge should marry. And there was Gatherum Castle. Gatherum was rather a trouble than otherwise. He had ever felt it to be so, but had nevertheless always kept it open perhaps for a month in the year. His uncle had always resided there for a fortnight at Christmas. When Silverbridge was married it would become the young man's duty to do something of the same kind. Gatherum was the White Elephant of the family, and Silverbridge must enter in upon his share of the trouble.

Williams was busy at the forge under the pleasant shade of the great banyan-tree. Resting his hammer on the anvil, he looked up.

""Will you come?"" \n\nWilliams was busy at the forge under the pleasant shade of the great banyan-tree. Resting his hammer on the anvil, he looked up. \n\n""No,"" he answered. ""I can\'t go till I\'ve finished this spade. It\'s the last bit of iron we have left that\'ll serve for such a purpose."" \n\n""That\'s no reason why you should not let it lie till the afternoon or to-morrow."" \n\n""True, but I\'ve got another reason for pushing through with it. Isaac Martin says the want of a spade keeps him idle, and you know it\'s a pity to encourage idleness in a lazy fellow."" \n\n""You are right. What is Martin about just now?"" \n\n""Working at the big water-tank. It suits him, a heavy quiet sort of job with the pick, requiring no energy or thought,--only a sleepy sort o\' perseverance, of which long-legged Isaac has plenty."" \n\n""Come, now,"" returned Young, with a laugh. ""I see you are getting jealous of Martin\'s superior intellect. But where are Quintal and McCoy?"" \n\n""Diggin\' in their gardens, I suppose. Leastwise, I heerd Mr Christian say to Mainmast he\'d seen \'em go off in that direction. Mr Christian himself has gone to his old outlook aloft on the mountains. If he don\'t see a sail at last it won\'t be for want o\' keepin\' a bright look-out."" \n\nThe armourer smiled grimly as he thrust the edge of the half-formed spade into the fire, and began to blow his bellows.

""I'm going to the cliffs to-day, Williams,"" said Young one morning. ""Will you come?"" 

Williams was busy at the forge under the pleasant shade of the great banyan-tree. Resting his hammer on the anvil, he looked up. 

""No,"" he answered. ""I can't go till I've finished this spade. It's the last bit of iron we have left that'll serve for such a purpose."" 

""That's no reason why you should not let it lie till the afternoon or to-morrow."" 

""True, but I've got another reason for pushing through with it. Isaac Martin says the want of a spade keeps him idle, and you know it's a pity to encourage idleness in a lazy fellow."" 

""You are right. What is Martin about just now?"" 

""Working at the big water-tank. It suits him, a heavy quiet sort of job with the pick, requiring no energy or thought,--only a sleepy sort o' perseverance, of which long-legged Isaac has plenty."" 

""Come, now,"" returned Young, with a laugh. ""I see you are getting jealous of Martin's superior intellect. But where are Quintal and McCoy?"" 

""Diggin' in their gardens, I suppose. Leastwise, I heerd Mr Christian say to Mainmast he'd seen 'em go off in that direction. Mr Christian himself has gone to his old outlook aloft on the mountains. If he don't see a sail at last it won't be for want o' keepin' a bright look-out."" 

The armourer smiled grimly as he thrust the edge of the half-formed spade into the fire, and began to blow his bellows. ","Context: CHAPTER TEN.

His mother asked ""Why not?"" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. 

Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. 

Tim answered, ""I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess."" 

""Well, we'll be there for you, either way"" his mother said. 

Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be. 

3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. 

It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, ""What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?"" 

Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.","Context: I don't think I can win the race Tim told his parents over breakfast.

By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, ""What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?"" 

Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.
 Question:What did his mother say?
 Answer:""Why not?"".
 Question:His father?
 Answer:he was silent.
 Question:What did Tim think?
 Answer:","['I don\'t think I can win the race Tim told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked ""Why not?"" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn\'t believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn\'t a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn\'t like to run. \n\nTim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school\'s Spring Fun Run. \n\nTim answered, ""I\'m going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess."" \n\n""Well, we\'ll be there for you, either way"" his mother said. \n\nTim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn\'t even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be. \n\n3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. \n\nIt was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim\'s father asked, ""What took you so long? I\'m surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn\'t win?"" \n\nTim thought about why he signed up.

According to the Peruvian Times, four American tourists were detained on March 14 for getting naked and posing for photos at the site. 

In a pair of separate incidents earlier in the week, two Canadians and two Australians were detained for stripping down for pictures at Machu Picchu. 

The bare-it-all episodes followed a 2013 incident in which a naked couple was videotaped by other tourists while streaking across Machu Picchu's grass field and bounding down a stone staircase like a pair of adolescent antelopes. 

The website My Naked Trip features images of an Israeli man named Amichay Rab posing in the buff at sites around South America, including Machu Picchu. 

Rab's long, curly hair and bold poses have won him a cluster of followers. 

The photos and video have made the rounds on social media. 

Peruvian officials are not amused. 

Crackdown 

Peru's Ministry of Culture has denounced the spectacle of nude visitors at Machu Picchu as ""disrespectful"" and ""unfortunate events that threaten cultural heritage."" 

""There are places in the world that people can get naked, but not all places are (appropriate) for getting undressed,"" Alfredo Mormontoy Atayupanqui, director of archaeological resources for Peru's Ministry of Culture, tells CNN. 

According to Mormontoy, park rules printed on the back of admission tickets warn visitors against being nude in public. 

""Tourists should comply with local rules and regulations when they are traveling, otherwise there will be thousands of problems,"" he says.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice.

His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his ""Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners."" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. 

Like most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth ""by hook and by crook."" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. 

Bunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. 

Bunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). 

The Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. 

""The Vanity Fair,"" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed.","Context: British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628.

To bound from the depths of despair to the pinnacles of hope is by no means an uncommon experience to vigorous youth. When Victor Ravenshaw awoke next morning after a profound and refreshing sleep, and looked up through the branches at the bright sky, despondency fled, and he felt ready for anything. He was early awake, but Peegwish had evidently been up long before him, for that wrinkled old savage had kindled the fire, and was seated on the other side of it wrapped in his blanket, smoking, and watching the preparation of breakfast. When Victor contemplated his solemn eyes glaring at a roasting duck, which suggested the idea that he had been sitting there and glaring all night, he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. 

""Come, I say, Vic,"" said Ian, roused by this from a comfortable nap, ""if you were a hyena there might be some excuse for you, but being only a man--forgive me, a boy--you ought to have more sense than to disturb your friends so."" 

""Oui, yes; dat is troo. Vraiment, it is too bad,"" growled Rollin, sitting up and stretching himself. ""Howsomewhatever, it is time to rise. Oui!"" 

""I should think it was,"" retorted Victor; ""the sun is already up, and you may be sure that Petawanaquat has tramped some miles this morning. Come, Peegwish, close your eyes a bit for fear they jump out. What have you got to give us, eh? Robbiboo, ducks, and--no, is it tea? Well, we _are_ in luck to have fallen in with you.""

Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave.

When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.

Authorities don't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim, Ahmed Al-Jumaili, Dallas Police Maj. Jeff Cotner said reporters, nor do they believe he knew Al-Jumaili's ethnicity. 

And they haven't given any indication Al-Jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend's apartment, if that in fact happened. Cotner said that, while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs, ""we (have been) unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment."" 

What police do believe, based on witness testimony and other evidence, is that the teenager shot and killed Al-Jumaili, for whatever reason. 

""When he saw Mr. Al-Jumaili and their family, he targeted them, he shot at them with intent,"" Cotner said of the suspect, who is under arrest. ""And as Mr. Al-Jumaili ran back toward his apartment, he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire."" 

Dallas police named the suspected shooter, though CNN is not identifying him yet since he's a minor and it's not clear if he'll be charged as an adult. The teen turns 18 in May, police said. 

Until the fatal shots ended Al-Jumalli's life, March 4 had been a day of fun and joy for Al-Jumaili and his family.

""When he saw Mr. Al-Jumaili and their family, he targeted them, he shot at them with intent,"" Cotner said of the suspect, who is under arrest. ""And as Mr. Al-Jumaili ran back toward his apartment, he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire."" 

Dallas police named the suspected shooter, though CNN is not identifying him yet since he's a minor and it's not clear if he'll be charged as an adult. The teen turns 18 in May, police said. 

Until the fatal shots ended Al-Jumalli's life, March 4 had been a day of fun and joy for Al-Jumaili and his family. 
 Question:How old?
 Answer:17.
 Question:Was he identified by name?
 Answer:","['(CNN)A 17-year-old male fatally shot an Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown, targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside, Dallas police said Friday. \n\nAuthorities don\'t believe the suspected shooter knew the victim, Ahmed Al-Jumaili, Dallas Police Maj. Jeff Cotner said reporters, nor do they believe he knew Al-Jumaili\'s ethnicity. \n\nAnd they haven\'t given any indication Al-Jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend\'s apartment, if that in fact happened.

Now 13, the young chef is being praised as a ""food prodigy "". He will spend his summer apprenticing with some of the best chefs at LA's famous restaurants, MSNBC Nightly New reports. 

Mc Garry began making a name for himself in the culinary world when John Sedlar, owner of the trendy Playa Restaurant, let Mc Garry take over the kitchen for a special nine-course meal. The meal sold out almost instantly. 

""Flynn is a very unusual young man, and he's very, very passionate,"" owner John Sedlar told MSNBC. 

By usual teenage boy standards, it's true. So strong is his passion for cooking that the young man has turned his bedroom into an experimental kitchen laboratory. 

Instead of video game consoles, baseball trophies and movie posters, Mc Garry's room is lined with mixers, pots and pans, cutting boards and a stainless steel worktable. It's where Mc Garry cooks his monthly pop-up dinners, which are served from his family's dining room, a monthly supper club he calls Eureka. 

Mc Garry is deft and confident in the kitchen, with skills he's been practicing since he was a child. What started out as a means of self-preservation from his mom's unsatisfactory cooking has turned into a passion that the teen hopes to develop into a career. 

""My goal? Michelin three stars, a restaurant in the top 50 list,"" he told MSNBC. ""Hopefully the top five."" Meanwhile, Mc Garry's 13-year-old resume is already richer and more impressive than most cooks many times his age. 

Mc Garry isn't the only talented young prodigy to surprise experts in his field in recent years.

Kim Jong-il has named his brother-in-law Jang Song Thaek to a top military board. 

The addition of his kin to the powerful National Defense Commission also solidifies his standing, Yonhap said. 

Kim was reappointed Thursday as chairman of the military board in his first major public appearance since a reported stroke in August. His brother-in-law, Jang Song Thaek, is considered his right-hand man, according to Yonhap. 

Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, currently serves as a director of the Workers' Party, Yonhap said. 

""Kim wants to keep the military in check and secure loyalty to both the military and the party,"" Cha Doo-hyeogn, a North Korea expert, told Yonhap. 

Kim also increased the number of members in the military agency to 13, from eight, Yonhap said. 

""Overall, the power of the National Defense Commission was strengthened,"" Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Ho-nyoun, told Yonhap in a briefing. 

There were no other major changes in the new parliament, which signifies that Kim, 67, is prepared to maintain the status quo as he readies someone to take over from him, analysts told Yonhap. 

Kim's recent health problems and long absence from public functions have prompted speculation on whether he is ready to groom an heir to the world's only communist dynasty.

It developed from a system produced by Thomas Wade, during the mid-19th century, and was given completed form with Herbert A. Giles's ""Chinese–English Dictionary"" of 1892. 

Wade–Giles was the system of transcription in the English-speaking world for most of the 20th century, used in standard reference books and in English language books published before 1979. It replaced the Nanking dialect-based romanization systems that had been common until the late 19th century, such as the Postal Romanization (still used in some place-names).

Outside mainland China, it has mostly been replaced by Pīnyīn, even though Taiwan implements a multitude of Romanization systems in daily life. Additionally, its usage can be seen in the common English names of certain individuals and locations such as Chiang Ching-kuo. 

Wade–Giles was developed by Thomas Francis Wade, a scholar of Chinese and a British ambassador in China who was the first professor of Chinese at Cambridge University. Wade published in 1867 the first textbook on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin in English, ""Yü-yen Tzŭ-êrh Chi"" (traditional: ; simplified: 语言自迩集), which became the basis for the Romanization system later known as Wade–Giles.

Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using ""home signs"". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. 

So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. 

While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. 

On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.","Context: American sign language has an interesting history.

However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. 

While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. 

On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.
 Question:Was there anyone else?
 Answer:Yes.
 Question:Who?
 Answer:","['American sign language has an interesting history. Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using ""home signs"". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. \n\nSo, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor\'s daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf.

The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. 

It was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, ""I can stay"". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. 

We got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll ""Never"" forget. 

On Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. 

When we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock. That day was forever etched into our memories. 

It still hurts to think about it. Wishing we could have grown old together. Wondering how it would have been. I'm sure It WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.","Context: The story of the day I lost my best friend to a car accident. The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon.

Harry Reid, 75, is recovering at home after he broke ""a number of ribs and bones in his face"" when he was exercising, his office said Friday in a statement. 

The Nevada Democrat was using a piece of equipment to exercise on Thursday when it broke, causing him to fall. 

His doctors expect a full recovery, and he's set to return to Washington over the weekend before the Senate reconvenes next week. 

According to the statement, the Senate Democratic Leader was treated and admitted overnight as a precaution at University Medical Center in Las Vegas after first being transported to St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson by his security detail. 

President Barack Obama called Reid on Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters, ""to wish him a full and speedy recovery."" 

Reid's office later announced Friday that Reid had been discharged from the hospital.

'}]","Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896. He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. 

Born into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. 

He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. 

His first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12. When he was 16, he was forced to leave St. Paul Academy for neglecting his studies. He attended Newman School, a prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1911-1912, and entered Princeton University in 1913 as a member of the Class of 1917. There he became friends with future critics and writers Edmund Wilson (Class of 1916) and John Peale Bishop (Class of 1917), and wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club. He was also a member of the University Cottage Club, which still displays Fitzgerald's desk and writing materials in its library. A poor student, Fitzgerald left Princeton to enlist in the US Army during World War I; however, the war ended shortly after Fitzgerald's enlistment. 

Fitzgerald had been an alcoholic since his college days, leaving him in poor health by the late 1930s.

'}]","Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896. He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. 

Born into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. 

He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the ""Lost Generation"" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. 

His first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12. When he was 16, he was forced to leave St. Paul Academy for neglecting his studies. He attended Newman School, a prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1911-1912, and entered Princeton University in 1913 as a member of the Class of 1917. There he became friends with future critics and writers Edmund Wilson (Class of 1916) and John Peale Bishop (Class of 1917), and wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club. He was also a member of the University Cottage Club, which still displays Fitzgerald's desk and writing materials in its library. A poor student, Fitzgerald left Princeton to enlist in the US Army during World War I; however, the war ended shortly after Fitzgerald's enlistment. 

Fitzgerald had been an alcoholic since his college days, leaving him in poor health by the late 1930s. Fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of tuberculosis in 1919, and died of a heart attack in 1940.","Context: Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896. He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. 

Born into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth.

Bolton, who had crept in after Fred, with proper delicacy of feeling retired the moment he found how matters stood, and left father and son to expend, in the privacy of that chamber of snow, those feelings and emotions which can be better imagined than described. 

The first impulse of the men was to give three cheers, but Bolton checked them in the bud. 

""No, no, lads. We must hold on,"" he said in an eager but subdued voice. ""Doubtless it would be pleasant to vent our feelings in a hearty cheer, but it would startle the old gentleman inside. Get along with you, and let us get ready a good supper."" 

""Oh morther!"" exclaimed O'Riley, holding on to his sides as if he believed what he said, ""me biler'll bust av ye don't let me screech."" 

""Squeeze down the safety-valve a bit longer, then,"" cried Bolton, as they hurried along with the whole population to the outskirts of the village. ""Now, then, ye may fire away; they won't hear ye--Huzza!""

The ""Lone Survivor"" actor is being charged with felony aggravated assault and intoxication, prosecuting attorney Ryan Stack of the Summit County (Utah) Attorney's Office said Thursday. 

Legal papers allege that Hirsch had a verbal and physical altercation with Daniele Bernfeld -- a Paramount executive -- at TAO nightclub in Park City during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in January. 

The early morning altercation reportedly involved Hirsch putting Bernfeld into a chokehold so forceful that she ""couldn't breathe"" and caused her to black out. Two bystanders pulled Hirsch off of Bernfeld before police arrived. Some ""redness"" was seen around Bernfeld's neck, according to authorities. 

The incident happened after Hirsch allegedly confronted Bernfeld, calling her a ""rich kid"" and questioning why she looked ""so tough."" Hirsch reportedly admitted to being in a verbal confrontation with Bernfeld and that he had consumed three to four drinks that evening. He also claimed that he did not know Bernfeld personally. 

That's not quite the same story he's sharing now. According to Hirsch's lawyer Robert Offer, he consumed an ""enormous amount of alcohol that night"" and has since checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation facility, where he currently remains. Offer says Hirsch has no memory of what happened at the time of the allegations but is ""devastated"" over the incident. 

Hirsch was at Sundance for the premiere of ""Ten Thousands Saints,"" in which he stars with Ethan Hawke.

I am looking forward to bringing the team together for our upcoming match against Mexico on August 10th and starting on the road towards qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup."" \n\nKlinsmann, who led Germany to third place in the 2006 World Cup finals, already lives in California and has been linked with the position for some time. \n\nHowever, his reputation dipped slightly after taking over as Bayern Munich coach in 2008, losing his job after just a year in charge of the Bavarian giants. \n\nDuring his playing career, Klinsmann was respected as one of the greatest strikers of his era. \n\nHe scored 232 goals in 516 games during a 17-year club career that took in spells with Bayern, Italian side Inter Milan and English club Tottenham Hotspur.

Edgar and Nina Otto show off 10-week-old Lancey, a clone of ""the most human of any dog we've ever had."" 

A Boca Raton, Florida, couple paid a California firm $155,000 to clone their beloved Labrador retriever, who died from cancer a year ago. The clone, a 10-week-old puppy dubbed Lancey, was hand-delivered to them earlier this week by Lou Hawthorne, chairman of BioArts International, a biotechnology company. 

""One minute with Lancey and you know he's special. He's both extremely aware and very sweet,"" Hawthorne said in a BioArts statement. 

Edgar and Nina Otto said they began thinking about cloning Sir Lancelot about five years ago. 

""I said 'Well, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have his DNA frozen,' and that's what we did,"" Nina Otto told CNN affiliate WPBF. 

The Ottos were one of five families to bid and win a BioArts auction for a chance to clone their family dog, according to a BioArts statement. Lancey is the world's first commercially cloned dog, the company said; the Ottos are the first of six current clients to receive their clone. 

Sir Lancelot's DNA sample was sent to the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul, South Korea, which provides cloning services to BioArts. Researchers there put the DNA into an egg, and Lancey was born November 18, according to BioArts. 

The Ottos said they have had many beloved dogs over the years -- and have nine others currently -- but maintain Sir Lancelot was special. ","Context: (CNN) -- Every dog has his day, but Sir Lancelot -- or at least his carbon copy -- has a second one.

Here are some that have attracted the biggest headlines: 

Michael Vick's dog fighting arrest 

Allegations of Vick's participation in dog fighting activities began to swirl in April 2007. 

Within three months, the Atlanta Falcons quarterback and three associates were indicted in federal court. 

By the end of August, Vick reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors on one charge of conspiracy involving illegal dog fighting. Vick admitted participating in killing dogs and operating a business enterprise that involved illegal gambling. 

Goodell notified Vick that he was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely, without pay. 

Vick served 20 months for the conviction. 

In 2009, Goodell reinstated Vick to the league on a conditional basis. In 2011, he signed a six-year, $100 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, making Vick one of the highest earning players in the NFL. 

Vick is now a backup quarterback for the New York Jets. 

Plaxico Buress' nightclub incident 

The former New York Giants wide receiver accidentally shot himself in the leg with a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol he was carrying in his waistband. The incident happened November 2008, in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan.

These may sound like dreams at present. But the dreams may soon come true as research findings in laboratories are being turned into products more rapidly in the new century, according to experts participating in the fourth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Technomart, a technology exhibition and trade fair in Suzhou. 

""Most people think nano-technology is too far-fetched to be real. But in fact nano-technology has been applied in a wide range of fields, such as medicine. It is coming into our daily life,"" said Cheng Jiachong from a Hong Kong-based nano-technology firm. 

Nano-technology based on the nanometer, the unit of which is a billionth of a meter, enables scientists to have new concepts of disease diagnosis and treatment on a molecular and atomic scale, Cheng said. 

By using nanometer particles, a doctor can separate the fetus cells from the blood of a pregnant woman to see if the development of the fetus is normal. This method is also being used in the early diagnosis of cancer and heart disease, he said. 

One of the most significant impacts of nano-technology is at the bio-inorganic materials interface, according to Greg Tegart, executive advisor of the APEC Center for Technology Foresight. 

""By combining enzymes and silicon chips we can produce biosensors. These could be implanted in humans or animals to monitor health and to deliver corrective doses of drugs,"" he told the participants a technology forum during the exhibition. 

""Nano-technology could affect the production of nearly every man-made object, from automobiles, tires and computer circuits , to advanced medicines and tissue replacement, and lead to the invention of objects yet to be imagined,"" said David Minns, a special advisor to the National Research Council of Canada. 

It has been shown that carbon nano-tubes are ten times as strong as steel, with one sixth of the weight, and nano-scale systems have the potential to make supersonic transport cost- effective and to increase computer efficiency by millions of times, he said. 

The experts agreed that the APEC technology exhibition and trade fair provided many chances for exchanges of innovative ideas and products.","Context: Simply by analyzing a drop of blood, a doctor will be able to diagnose a birth defect or even cancer when it is in the early stage; using new technology, a material lighter but much stronger than steel can be produced.

It is coming into our daily life,"" said Cheng Jiachong from a Hong Kong-based nano-technology firm. \n\nNano-technology based on the nanometer, the unit of which is a billionth of a meter, enables scientists to have new concepts of disease diagnosis and treatment on a molecular and atomic scale, Cheng said. \n\nBy using nanometer particles, a doctor can separate the fetus cells from the blood of a pregnant woman to see if the development of the fetus is normal. This method is also being used in the early diagnosis of cancer and heart disease, he said. \n\nOne of the most significant impacts of nano-technology is at the bio-inorganic materials interface, according to Greg Tegart, executive advisor of the APEC Center for Technology Foresight. \n\n""By combining enzymes and silicon chips we can produce biosensors. These could be implanted in humans or animals to monitor health and to deliver corrective doses of drugs,"" he told the participants a technology forum during the exhibition. \n\n""Nano-technology could affect the production of nearly every man-made object, from automobiles, tires and computer circuits , to advanced medicines and tissue replacement, and lead to the invention of objects yet to be imagined,"" said David Minns, a special advisor to the National Research Council of Canada. \n\nIt has been shown that carbon nano-tubes are ten times as strong as steel, with one sixth of the weight, and nano-scale systems have the potential to make supersonic transport cost- effective and to increase computer efficiency by millions of times, he said. \n\nThe experts agreed that the APEC technology exhibition and trade fair provided many chances for exchanges of innovative ideas and products.', 'Question: For what purpose?', 'Answer: to monitor health.', 'Anothing else?']","[1, 1, 1,

Every U.S. administration from Reagan to Obama has tried to reach out to Iran. Unfortunately, these efforts all failed because the circumstances for rapprochement were not quite right -- unlike today, where Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, has been determined to outflank his ideological opponents in Tehran and reach a deal with the West. 

The Obama administration seems equally determined -- despite opposition from Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as an obstructive Congress -- to welcome the Iranians back into the international community, so long as they agree to play by the rules. 

This is Obama's ""opening to China"" moment and he must seize it. 

Ever since Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and initiated the 444-day Iran-hostage crisis, the United States and Iran have been regional arch-nemeses.

Baby's Best Friend 

When Jennifer Merritt brought her baby, Arielle, home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: ""If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!""says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. 

u Introduce Them with Care 

Your newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: ""Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell."" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. 

To introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. 

u Learn the Safety Basics 

No matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate.","Context: When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff.

Don\'t panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it\'ll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby\'s crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet\'s access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate.', 'Question: What did her partner do while leaving hospital?', 'Answer: unknown.', 'what is the name of her dog?']","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

On the following day, Tuesday, the Boncassens went, and then there were none of the guests left but Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel Grex,--with of course Miss Cassewary. The Duke had especially asked both Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel to remain, the former, through his anxiety to show his repentance for the injustice he had formerly done her, and the latter in the hope that something might be settled as soon as the crowd of visitors should have gone. He had never spoken quite distinctly to Mabel. He had felt that the manner in which he had learned his son's purpose,--that which once had been his son's purpose,--forbade him to do so. But he had so spoken as to make Lady Mabel quite aware of his wish. He would not have told her how sure he was that Silverbridge would keep no more racehorses, how he trusted that Silverbridge had done with betting, how he believed that the young member would take a real interest in the House of Commons, had he not intended that she should take a special interest in the young man. And then he had spoken about the house in London. It was to be made over to Silverbridge as soon as Silverbridge should marry. And there was Gatherum Castle. Gatherum was rather a trouble than otherwise. He had ever felt it to be so, but had nevertheless always kept it open perhaps for a month in the year. His uncle had always resided there for a fortnight at Christmas. When Silverbridge was married it would become the young man's duty to do something of the same kind. Gatherum was the White Elephant of the family, and Silverbridge must enter in upon his share of the trouble. He did not know that in saying all this he was offering his son as a husband to Lady Mabel, but she understood it as thoroughly as though he had spoken the words. ","Context: CHAPTER LIV

Dick had stopped the touring car in the midst of a quantity of broken glass bottles. The glass covered the road from side to side, and had evidently been put there on purpose.

""Well, we'll have to fix the tire, that is all there is to it,"" said the oldest Rover. ""Might as well get out while we are doing it,"" he added to the girls.

He never lost his baby teeth, never grew taller than about 30 inches and never weighed more than 28 pounds. They did estimate, however, that he would not live to see his 12th birthday. 

As a boy I learned to feed and clothe Mike. As a teenager, I babysat for my ""big brother"" and learned use the proper medicine to prevent the seizures that caused him to tremble. 

Many people said he would never walk or talk . He never did learn to walk, but he did learn to talk --not even in complete sentences, but he had the basics down. If he was hungry, thirsty, happy or sad, we knew. He knew names too. I was Kagun, not Kevin. But that changed with a beard I grew during the summer before college. Family members said it was ugly. Mike heard it. 

""Look who's at home. Who's that?"" they'd say to Mike. ""Ugly,"" he would respond with delight. 

All of which--to me--was normal, for he was the only brother I knew. The only time I thought of the differences between us was when others pointed them out. 

My circle of friends widened when I entered high school. One day Mom asked if my new friends would have a problem seeing Mike for the first time. ""If they don't accept Mike, they don't accept me and they aren't welcome,"" I said. 

And if I didn't think of him as different, I never thought about him dying either. On a warm fall night in 1998, Mike had a seizure. With this first seizure, Mike's life was beginning to fade. 

On March 15, 1999, Mike died. Michael Patrick Harter--just 26 years old-- died in Mom's arms. 

We never had those great talks other brothers have about women, work and parents. We never played catch or talked about our dreams. But Mike taught me compassion and strength. He taught me respect for those less fortunate than myself. And he taught me an appreciation of the beauty in the simplest things. 

Physically and mentally, I was my brother's keeper. Spiritually, Mike was and is my keeper--a nearly silent guardian angel.","Context: My brother, Michael, was born one month before his due date and he also had cerebral palsy . He was _ .

My circle of friends widened when I entered high school. One day Mom asked if my new friends would have a problem seeing Mike for the first time. ""If they don't accept Mike, they don't accept me and they aren't welcome,"" I said. 

And if I didn't think of him as different, I never thought about him dying either. On a warm fall night in 1998, Mike had a seizure. With this first seizure, Mike's life was beginning to fade. 

On March 15, 1999, Mike died. Michael Patrick Harter--just 26 years old-- died in Mom's arms. 

We never had those great talks other brothers have about women, work and parents. We never played catch or talked about our dreams. But Mike taught me compassion and strength. He taught me respect for those less fortunate than myself. And he taught me an appreciation of the beauty in the simplest things. 

Physically and mentally, I was my brother's keeper. Spiritually, Mike was and is my keeper--a nearly silent guardian angel.
 Question:Anything else?
 Answer:Yes.
 Question:What else?
 Answer:","['My brother, Michael, was born one month before his due date and he also had cerebral palsy . He was _ . He never lost his baby teeth, never grew taller than about 30 inches and never weighed more than 28 pounds. They did estimate, however, that he would not live to see his 12th birthday. \n\nAs a boy I learned to feed and clothe Mike. As a teenager, I babysat for my ""big brother"" and learned use the proper medicine to prevent the seizures that caused him to tremble. \n\nMany people said he would never walk or talk . He never did learn to walk, but he did learn to talk --not even in complete sentences, but he had the basics down. If he was hungry, thirsty, happy or sad, we knew. He knew names too. I was Kagun, not Kevin. But that changed with a beard I grew during the summer before college. Family members said it was ugly. Mike heard it. \n\n""Look who\'s at home.

""I'm going to the cliffs to-day, Williams,"" said Young one morning. ""Will you come?"" 

Williams was busy at the forge under the pleasant shade of the great banyan-tree. Resting his hammer on the anvil, he looked up. 

""No,"" he answered. ""I can't go till I've finished this spade. It's the last bit of iron we have left that'll serve for such a purpose."" 

""That's no reason why you should not let it lie till the afternoon or to-morrow.""

""Come, now,"" returned Young, with a laugh. ""I see you are getting jealous of Martin's superior intellect. But where are Quintal and McCoy?"" 

""Diggin' in their gardens, I suppose. Leastwise, I heerd Mr Christian say to Mainmast he'd seen 'em go off in that direction. Mr Christian himself has gone to his old outlook aloft on the mountains. If he don't see a sail at last it won't be for want o' keepin' a bright look-out.""

On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain was against the president's plan for limited intervention but on Wednesday changed his mind. Sen. Marco Rubio was for intervention in Syria for the past two years, but he cannot support Obama's plan for military strikes. 

On the Democratic side, many who have previously defended Obama's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to his predecessor for its caution and thoughtfulness now seem delighted to support his new war in Syria. Then there are Democrats who seem a little less fuzzy on their long-held principles and do not support intervening in Syria. 

Obama's own administration seems confused as well. Secretary of State John Kerry has had to backpedal more than once after contradicting official policy in Syria, which is admittedly hard to discern.

'Can you throw any light on this, Mr. Lyle?' asked the Duchess of a young man who sat next her. ","Context: CHAPTER III. 

'And you walked here!' said Lady Everingham to Coningsby, when the stir of arranging themselves at dinner had subsided. 'Only think, papa, Mr. Coningsby walked here! I also am a great walker.' 

'I had heard much of the forest,' said Coningsby. 

'Which I am sure did not disappoint you,' said the Duke. 

'But forests without adventures!' said Lady Everingham, a little shrugging her pretty shoulders. 

'But I had an adventure,' said Coningsby. 

'Oh! tell it us by all means!' said the Lady, with great animation. 'Adventures are my weakness. I have had more adventures than any one. Have I not had, Augustus?' she added, addressing her husband. 

'But you make everything out to be an adventure, Isabel,' said Lord Everingham. I dare say that Mr. Coningsby's was more substantial.' And looking at our young friend, he invited him to inform them. 

'I met a most extraordinary man,' said Coningsby. 

'It should have been a heroine,' exclaimed Lady Everingham. 

'Do you know anybody in this neighbourhood who rides the finest Arab in the world?' asked Coningsby. 'She is called ""the Daughter of the Star,"" and was given to her rider by the Pacha of Egypt.' 

'This is really an adventure,' said Lady Everingham, interested. 

'The Daughter of the Star!' said Lady Theresa. 'What a pretty name! Percy has a horse called ""Sunbeam.""' 

'A fine Arab, the finest in the world!' said the Duke, who was fond of horse. 'Who can it be?' 

'Can you throw any light on this, Mr. Lyle?' asked the Duchess of a young man who sat next her.

At one end of the court the world's No. 1 female tennis star playing well within herself; at the other her sister, a long way away from regaining that form and status. 

""Venus has had a great week, and honestly, if she hadn't had to play so many matches, it would have been a much tougher match,"" Serena Williams said after comfortably beating her older sibling on Saturday to reach the final of the Family Circle Cup in Charleston. 

The 31-year-old was slightly overstating the rigors of the competition in South Carolina, a tournament that heralded the formation of the women's tour back in 1973 but has this week attracted just two of the world's top-10 players. 

Serena is one, and the other -- 10th-ranked Caroline Wozniacki -- crashed out in the quarterfinals on Friday against Swiss No. 63 Stefanie Vogele. 

Both Williams sisters won two matches on Friday to set up their first meeting since 2009, but it was defending champion Serena who looked the least affected as she won 6-1 6-2 in just 54 minutes. 

""She'll never admit it, but I don't think she was 100%,"" Serena said of her sister, who was diagnosed with a debilitating autoimmune disease before the 2011 U.S. Open -- a grand slam she has won twice, along with her five Wimbledons. 

""But you will never get that out of her. And quite frankly, three matches for her is much tougher than three matches for me. It's definitely not easy -- because I'm struggling, and I can't imagine what she must be feeling."" ","Context: (CNN) -- At times it was almost painful to watch.

The 31-year-old was slightly overstating the rigors of the competition in South Carolina, a tournament that heralded the formation of the women's tour back in 1973 but has this week attracted just two of the world's top-10 players. 

Serena is one, and the other -- 10th-ranked Caroline Wozniacki -- crashed out in the quarterfinals on Friday against Swiss No. 63 Stefanie Vogele. 

Both Williams sisters won two matches on Friday to set up their first meeting since 2009, but it was defending champion Serena who looked the least affected as she won 6-1 6-2 in just 54 minutes. 

""She'll never admit it, but I don't think she was 100%,"" Serena said of her sister, who was diagnosed with a debilitating autoimmune disease before the 2011 U.S. Open -- a grand slam she has won twice, along with her five Wimbledons. 

""But you will never get that out of her. And quite frankly, three matches for her is much tougher than three matches for me. It's definitely not easy -- because I'm struggling, and I can't imagine what she must be feeling.""

The start had been made, and now the three found themselves on a narrow mountain trail in a country that looked to be utterly uninhabited. 

For three days they had been close behind Tom and Ike Furner, this being proven by the remains of campfires and other indications. Once they had met some prospectors returning to the Klondyke and these men had told of passing the pair ahead, and that Furner had said they were bound for a spot not many miles from Lion Head called Twin Rocks.

According to the Peruvian Times, four American tourists were detained on March 14 for getting naked and posing for photos at the site. 

In a pair of separate incidents earlier in the week, two Canadians and two Australians were detained for stripping down for pictures at Machu Picchu. 

The bare-it-all episodes followed a 2013 incident in which a naked couple was videotaped by other tourists while streaking across Machu Picchu's grass field and bounding down a stone staircase like a pair of adolescent antelopes. 

The website My Naked Trip features images of an Israeli man named Amichay Rab posing in the buff at sites around South America, including Machu Picchu. 

Rab's long, curly hair and bold poses have won him a cluster of followers. 

The photos and video have made the rounds on social media. 

Peruvian officials are not amused. 

Crackdown 

Peru's Ministry of Culture has denounced the spectacle of nude visitors at Machu Picchu as ""disrespectful"" and ""unfortunate events that threaten cultural heritage."" 

""There are places in the world that people can get naked, but not all places are (appropriate) for getting undressed,"" Alfredo Mormontoy Atayupanqui, director of archaeological resources for Peru's Ministry of Culture, tells CNN. 

According to Mormontoy, park rules printed on the back of admission tickets warn visitors against being nude in public. 

""Tourists should comply with local rules and regulations when they are traveling, otherwise there will be thousands of problems,"" he says.

However, he is now a household film star in China. 

Wang is the youngest child of a poor family in Hebei Province. Dreaming of becoming an actor, he left home at the age of 8 to study kung fu at Shaolin Temple, since kung-fu actors seemed to appear most often on the big screen. 

At 14, he moved to Beijing for his acting career for the first time, with little money in his pocket. He worked at a construction site for 20 to 25 yuan per day, and spent his free time standing in front of the Beijing Film Studio, eager to be chosen as temporary actors. This was the hardest time for the boy. His opportunity finally came one day after he went for a role in the movie ""Blind Shaft"" . He was chosen to play a young coal miner. The movie won him three prizes in Thailand, France and Taiwan. But his success didn`t make any difference to his life. 

That year, he went home for the Spring Festival. He gave his family his earnings from the movie, around $ 250 and then returned to Beijing with 500 yuan, the same amount he had when he first came to the city. His life was as simple as before. 

Thanks to his natural performance in ""Blind Shaft"", he was invited by the famous director Feng Xiaogang to act in the film ""A World Without Thieves"" in 2004, which made him famous immediately. People called him ""Shagen"", the name of his character in the movie. 

Wang's work, ""Soldiers Sortie"" has made him the most popular actor on the Chinese mainland. For the actor, it's a dream coming true. 

""Dreams come true. I think my life is exactly a course of pursuing dreams. No matter how tough one thing is,I can make it as long as I put great effort into it.

Casey Anthony had been called a ""person of interest"" in her daughter's disappearance. 

Police had previously labeled Anthony -- who authorities said didn't report the 3-year-old child's disappearance until mid-July -- a ""person of interest"" in the case. 

""Casey is a suspect,"" said Orange County Sheriff's Department Capt. Angelo Nieves. ""She has been uncooperative, leading investigators down the wrong path and lying to them. She has not provided any credible information about the last time she saw her or where she was left."" 

Casey Anthony of Orlando, Florida, was arrested July 16 on suspicion of telling detectives lies about Caylee's disappearance. She was released on bail after that arrest and subsequent arrests on unrelated theft charges. 

Authorities said weeks ago that evidence suggests Caylee is dead. Investigators found evidence of human decomposition in the trunk of Anthony's car, authorities have said. 

Law enforcement sources also suggested that a strand of hair found in the trunk of the car was Caylee's. Watch Nancy Grace speak to Casey Anthony's ""babysitter"" » 

Authorities also have said they found traces of chloroform in the car Anthony drove and Internet searches of chloroform Web sites on her computer. 

Anthony and her daughter have garnered national headlines and served as fodder for nightly crime shows. Protesters have held vigils outside Anthony's home pleading with her to give police more information about Caylee's whereabouts. 

In connection with her July arrest, Anthony was charged with child neglect, making false official statements and obstructing a criminal investigation.

Casey Anthony of Orlando, Florida, was arrested July 16 on suspicion of telling detectives lies about Caylee's disappearance. She was released on bail after that arrest and subsequent arrests on unrelated theft charges. 

Authorities said weeks ago that evidence suggests Caylee is dead. Investigators found evidence of human decomposition in the trunk of Anthony's car, authorities have said. 

Law enforcement sources also suggested that a strand of hair found in the trunk of the car was Caylee's. Watch Nancy Grace speak to Casey Anthony's ""babysitter"" » 

Authorities also have said they found traces of chloroform in the car Anthony drove and Internet searches of chloroform Web sites on her computer. 

Anthony and her daughter have garnered national headlines and served as fodder for nightly crime shows. Protesters have held vigils outside Anthony's home pleading with her to give police more information about Caylee's whereabouts. 

In connection with her July arrest, Anthony was charged with child neglect, making false official statements and obstructing a criminal investigation.

The Russian lost to China's Li Na 7-6 (7-4) 6-4, who had herself not won a match, or even a set, since August. 

It was a match that ebbed and flowed as Li came from 2-4 down in the first set to force a tie-break, which she won despite losing the first four points. 

Li, who this year became the first Asian Grand Slam winner after victory in the French Open, then fought off a late Sharapova surge when 5-2 up to take the second set 6-4. The defeat followed Sharapova's capitulation against U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur 6-1, 7-5 on Wednesday. 

""I really wasn't thinking about too much during the match,"" Li was quoted as saying on the WTA's official website after the match. 

""I'm so happy I was able to beat Maria because she's a top player, and also today was my first match ever at the Championships, so I want to thank all the crowd here for supporting me."" 

But for Sharapova, who has struggled with an ankle injury but had the chance to become world number one with victory in Istanbul, there were some positives to be taken from two defeats in two days. 

""I just have to be pleased that I recovered quickly enough to allow myself a chance of playing here,"" she told AFP.

In late July, Bo Xilai, a former darling of the party, was finally indicted on corruption charges. His trial is expected to begin on Thursday, August 22, the latest chapter in a gripping tale of murder, betrayal and political factionalism. 

The authorities claim he abused his official state position to seek financial benefits, resulting in ""huge losses to the nation and the people."" 

""The circumstances are extremely serious,"" a statement in the state-run Xinhua news agency declared a few days later. 

But a source close to the Bo family for decades says the claims are ""ridiculous.""

Until March 2012, the charismatic, populist leader was a member of the policy-making politburo of the Communist Party and party chief of Chongqing, a megacity in southwestern China. 

Bo, 64, is currently in detention, awaiting a trial that could cap the biggest political scandal to hit China in decades. He has not been seen in public since news of the scandal emerged, and he was stripped of his role as Chongqing party chief and later his prestigious politburo post. 

TIMELINE: Bo's fall from grace 

Bo stands accused of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. According to the indictment documents, as a civil servant he took advantage of his position to seek profit from others and accepted an extremely large amount of money and properties, Xinhua reported. The documents don't quantify the amount of bribes allegedly accepted, but published reports say it could be as much as 20 million yuan ($3.3 million).

""Dick, we have made two enemies, that's sure,"" remarked Sam to his brother as they watched Flockley and Koswell depart. 

""It couldn't be helped if we have, Sam,"" was the reply. ""You are not sorry for what we did at the Sanderson house, are you?"" 

""Not in the least. What we should have done was to give those chaps a sound thrashing."" 

""They seem to have a number of friends here. Probably they will do all they can to make life at this college miserable for us."" 

""Well, if they do too much, I reckon we can do something too."" 

Some new students had been standing at a distance watching the scene described in the last chapter. Now one of them approached and nodded pleasantly. 

""Freshmen?"" he asked. 

""Yes,"" answered both of the Rovers. 

""So am I. My name is Stanley Browne. What's yours?"" 

""Dick Rover, and this is my brother Sam."" 

""Oh, are you Dick Rover? I've heard about you. My cousin knows you real well."" 

""Who is your cousin?"" 

""Larry Colby."" 

""Larry!"" cried Dick. ""Well, I guess he does know us well. We've had some great times together at Putnam Hall and elsewhere. So you are Larry's cousin? I am real glad to know you."" And Dick held out his hand. 

""Larry is one of our best chums,"" said Sam, also shaking hands. ""I remember now that he has spoken of you. I am glad to know somebody at this place."" And Sam smiled broadly. Soon all three of the boys were on good terms, and Stanley Browne told the Rovers something about himself. ","Context: CHAPTER V

Hundreds have been killed, according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\nAndris Piebalgs, EU commissioner for development, announced the recovery package on Tuesday. \n\n""We will stand by Ivory Coast and its people by immediately starting to work with the government of President Ouattara to support him in getting the country on the right track towards reconciliation, democracy, economic recovery and sustainable development,"" he said. \n\nThe funding will provide support to ensure basic needs for citizens such as health, water, sanitation and to support the agricultural sector, Piebalgs said in a statement. It also will clear the Ivory Coast\'s debt accumulated through the European Investment Bank. \n\nTop military brass pledged their support to Ouattara in a ceremony Tuesday at a hotel in Abdijan. Gen. Phillipe Mangou, Gbagbo\'s former army chief of staff, said on state television that the generals were received by Ouattara and given orders to take measures to restore order in the country.

Torry Hansen's attorney, Ed Yarbrough, told CNN he will file a motion within a few weeks asking the court to modify or terminate the support, which was first ordered earlier this year. 

The United States and Russia last year signed an agreement to strengthen procedural safeguards for adoptions following the 2010 incident. 

Grandmother: Adopted boy sent back to Russia was violent 

Artyem Saveliev, adopted from a Russian orphanage, was put on a plane back to Moscow. The Shelbyville, Tennessee, family claimed they feared for their safety after a series of violent episodes from the boy, then 7. 

An investigation was launched after the child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry with a letter from his adoptive mother asking Russian authorities to annul the adoption. 

In the letter, Hansen said the boy was ""mentally unstable,"" and said she had been misled about his mental condition. 

The World Association for Children and Parents had coordinated the adoption. A lawsuit was filed against Hansen for breach of contract and child support. 

In May, the association said Artyem is still a U.S. citizen and under Tennessee law Hansen is legally considered to be his mother. 

The child has been living in a group care facility outside of Moscow. 

According to CNN Nashville affiliate WKRN, Hansen testified Friday in Lewisburg, Tennessee, that the boy wanted to kill her. 

But Larry Crain, the adoption agency's attorney, said the boy is not violent. ","Context: (CNN) -- The American woman who sent her adopted son back to Russia must pay $150,000 in child support, a Tennessee judge reaffirmed Friday.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims; and by the Brahmins in India. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning. 

In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship.

It was the royal color of the Kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922).

Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a ""coffee headache"", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache.

Sometimes other doctors ask him questions, because he knows more about some things that they do. Jim and Alice are two other doctors who became friends with Mark. Jim is 40 years old, and Alice is 25 years old. Sometimes they all have dinner together, and at other times they listen to music at Mark's house. \n\nIn his free time, Mark likes to play basketball. Mark works hard, and sometimes he wants to have fun. But really, his job is fun to him. When he wakes up in the morning, he always is excited thinking about how he can help people as a doctor."", 'Question: anyone else?', 'Answer: yes.', 'who?']","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

""When I found out that Jamey Rodemeyer killed himself -- I felt deeply troubled,"" Quinto posted. ""But when I found out that Jamey Rodemeyer had made an 'It Gets Better' video only months before taking his own life -- I felt indescribable despair. 

""I also made an 'It Gets Better' video last year in the wake of the senseless and tragic gay teen suicides that were sweeping the nation at the time,"" Quinto wrote. ""But in light of Jamey's death, it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality."" 

Rodemeyer was found dead September 18 outside his parents' home in Buffalo, New York. His parents said he had experienced years of bullying over his sexual orientation. His suicide has attracted the attention of such stars as Lady Gaga, who dedicated a song to him at a recent concert. 

The ""It Gets Better"" campaign is aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered youth who may experience bullying. 

""Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country,"" Quinto said. ""Gay kids need to stop killing themselves because they are made to feel worthless by cruel and relentless bullying. Parents need to teach their children principles of respect and acceptance. We are witnessing an enormous shift of collective consciousness throughout the world. I believe in the power of intention to change the landscape of our society -- and it is my intention to live an authentic life of compassion and integrity and action.""

""When I found out that Jamey Rodemeyer killed himself -- I felt deeply troubled,"" Quinto posted. ""But when I found out that Jamey Rodemeyer had made an 'It Gets Better' video only months before taking his own life -- I felt indescribable despair. 

""I also made an 'It Gets Better' video last year in the wake of the senseless and tragic gay teen suicides that were sweeping the nation at the time,"" Quinto wrote. ""But in light of Jamey's death, it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality."" 

Rodemeyer was found dead September 18 outside his parents' home in Buffalo, New York. His parents said he had experienced years of bullying over his sexual orientation. His suicide has attracted the attention of such stars as Lady Gaga, who dedicated a song to him at a recent concert. 

The ""It Gets Better"" campaign is aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered youth who may experience bullying. 

""Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country,"" Quinto said. ""Gay kids need to stop killing themselves because they are made to feel worthless by cruel and relentless bullying. Parents need to teach their children principles of respect and acceptance. We are witnessing an enormous shift of collective consciousness throughout the world.

It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.

""The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?"" McLean recalled. ""Nobody cared.

Billie had been standing near the wall, inspecting a portrait of the late Mr. Josiah Appleby, of which the kindest thing one can say is that one hopes it did not do him justice. She now shrank back against this wall, as if she were trying to get through it. The edge of the portrait's frame tilted her hat out of the straight, but in this supreme moment she did not even notice it. 

""Er--how do you do?"" she said. 

If she had not been an exceedingly pretty girl, one would have said that she spoke squeakily. The fighting spirit of the Bennetts, though it was considerable fighting spirit, had not risen to this emergency. It had ebbed out of her, leaving in its place a cold panic. She had seen this sort of thing in the movies--there was one series of pictures, ""The Dangers of Diana,"" where something of the kind had happened to the heroine in every reel--but she had not anticipated that it would ever happen to her; and consequently she had not thought out any plan for coping with such a situation. A grave error. In this world one should be prepared for everything, or where is one? 

""I've brought the revolver,"" said Mr. Peters. 

""So--so I see!"" said Billie. 

Mr. Peters nursed the weapon affectionately in his hand. He was rather a shy man with women as a rule, but what Sam had told him about her being interested in his revolver had made his heart warm to this girl. ","Context: CHAPTER XIII

In grainy black and white tones, it shows 13-year-old Martin Andrews sitting in a makeshift box, his leg chained. The look in his eyes is one of fear, fatigue and disbelief. He had just been rescued from a nightmare. 

""I was abducted by a sexually violent predator by the name of Richard Ausley, who had been twice convicted for sexually assaulting young boys, and he had taken me for eight days,"" Andrews recalled of his ordeal 37 years ago this month. ""I was left to die."" 

As a survivor of a sex crime, Andrews is one face of an issue the Supreme Court will revisit Tuesday: civil commitment, which allows the government to keep sex offenders in custody even after they have served their sentences. Twenty states have such laws, including Virginia, where Andrews was held captive and repeatedly assaulted. 

CNN normally doesn't name victims of sex crimes, but Andrews, now a victims' advocate, agreed to tell his story. 

On the other side of the debate is the first sex offender released from Virginia's civil commitment program, and one of just a handful nationwide. 

""I served my time for what I did, and I didn't feel like I should be incarcerated again,"" said this man, who asked that his identity not be revealed for fear of retribution. ""It was a scary thing to know that you could be committed to a mental institution for the rest of your life."" 

The man said mandatory therapy helped him, but he thinks that could have been initiated while he was in prison. ","Context: Woodbridge, Virginia (CNN) -- The police photograph is chilling.

""I was abducted by a sexually violent predator by the name of Richard Ausley, who had been twice convicted for sexually assaulting young boys, and he had taken me for eight days,"" Andrews recalled of his ordeal 37 years ago this month. ""I was left to die."" 

As a survivor of a sex crime, Andrews is one face of an issue the Supreme Court will revisit Tuesday: civil commitment, which allows the government to keep sex offenders in custody even after they have served their sentences. Twenty states have such laws, including Virginia, where Andrews was held captive and repeatedly assaulted. 

CNN normally doesn't name victims of sex crimes, but Andrews, now a victims' advocate, agreed to tell his story. 

On the other side of the debate is the first sex offender released from Virginia's civil commitment program, and one of just a handful nationwide. 

""I served my time for what I did, and I didn't feel like I should be incarcerated again,"" said this man, who asked that his identity not be revealed for fear of retribution. ""It was a scary thing to know that you could be committed to a mental institution for the rest of your life."" 

The man said mandatory therapy helped him, but he thinks that could have been initiated while he was in prison.

One day at lunch time, I was getting ready to eat my tuna fish sandwich and suddenly Mrs Elise asked me if she could buy my sandwich from me.

It was too expensive for my family, and I always carried my lunch and took the bag back home to use it again the next day. So you could understand my happiness when I had the chance to buy a hot lunch. When we finished lunch that day, Mrs Elise took me aside and said she wanted to explain why she had bought my sandwich. I really didn't care why, but it gave me a few minutes of her special attention, so I was quiet as she explained. She told me that she was a Catholic and Catholics didn't eat red meat on Fridays, they ate fish on Fridays. Oh, I couldn't wait to get home and tell my mother that from then on I wanted a tuna fish sandwich on Fridays. After my mother understood why, she gladly made tuna fish sandwiches for me on Fridays. She even made it with brown bread because she knew Mrs Elise liked brown bread. From then on, every Friday I could get in line with other kids for a hot lunch. I didn't care how many of the kids complained about cafeteria food. It tasted _ to me! I realize now that Mrs Elise could have made herself tuna fish sandwiches on Fridays. But she bought mine because she saw a little girl who was excited at the simple act of having a hot lunch. I will never forget Mrs Elise for her pity for me and generosity and what I should do is to follow her example.","Context: Mrs Elise was my teacher in the fourth grade.
